# Supply Chain Portfolio — Sandeep Dubey
**Created:** 2025-11-30

This repository contains three end-to-end, recruiter-ready supply chain analytics projects based on my professional experience at **Mytheresa**, **Tesla**, and **Amazon (intern)**.

**Purpose:** Showcase domain knowledge in Inventory Optimization, Procurement/RFQ Analytics, and Fulfillment Center Operations using Power BI, Python, and Excel-ready datasets. Each project folder includes datasets, README documentation, notebook outlines, DAX formulas, Power BI layout suggestions, and LinkedIn-ready copy for sharing your work with recruiters.
